# VOSS Sequencing Toolkit #

The purpose of this repository is to:

a) write reproducible code for sequencing of VOSS datasets
b) transition to R as a ubiquitous tool for data analysis
c) create automated tools for data collection and analysis

Feel free to push commits to the code so that we together can start building R competencies as well as usable analysis scripts.
